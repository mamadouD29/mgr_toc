			<h2>1. USE OF THE APP AND SERVICES</h2>

			<p>
				1.1. The Em Degree Tracker App is designed to assist students in
				tracking their academic progress, including grades for
				completed, in-progress, or pending classes. Users may input
				their grades in letter or numerical format and select their
				university, academic level, and program from a provided list
				within the App.
			</p>

			<p>
				1.2. The App serves solely as a tool for tracking academic
				progress and does not replace official university records or
				degree audits.
				<strong
					>Em Degree Tracker is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or
					directly connected to any educational institution,
					university, or academic body.</strong
				>
				Users should verify the accuracy of their academic information
				through their university's official website or application.

			<p>
				1.3. The information provided when using the App is not intended
				for distribution to or use by any person or entity in any

				their own initiative and are solely responsible for compliance
				with local laws, if and to the extent local laws are applicable.

				industry-specific regulations (including but not limited to the
				Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA),
				Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA), or the

			</p>

			<h2>20. CHANGES, MODIFICATIONS, AND INTERRUPTIONS</h2>

			<p>
				20.1. Emdidi Studio reserves the right to modify or replace
				these Terms at any time. Users will be notified of any material
				changes to the Terms, and continued use of the App after such
				modifications constitutes acceptance of the revised Terms.
			</p>

			<p>

				discontinue the App or Services (including any content,
				features, or pricing) at any time and for any reason, at our

				suspension, or discontinuance of the App or Services.
			</p>

			<p>
				20.3. We cannot guarantee that the App or Services will always
				be available. We may experience hardware, software, or other
				issues, or need to perform maintenance, resulting in
				interruptions, delays, or errors. You agree that we have no
				liability for any loss, damage, or inconvenience caused by your
				inability to access or use the App during any downtime or
				discontinuance. Nothing in these Terms obligates us to maintain
				or support the App or Services, or to provide corrections,
				updates, or releases.
			</p>

			<h2>21. TERM AND TERMINATION</h2>

			<p>
				21.1. These Terms remain in full force and effect while you use
				the Services.
			</p>

			<p>
				21.2. WITHOUT LIMITING ANY OTHER PROVISION OF THESE TERMS, WE
				RESERVE THE RIGHT, IN OUR SOLE DISCRETION AND WITHOUT NOTICE OR
				LIABILITY, TO DENY ACCESS TO AND USE OF THE SERVICES (INCLUDING
				BLOCKING CERTAIN IP ADDRESSES) TO ANY PERSON, FOR ANY REASON OR

			</p>

			<p>

				prohibited from registering and creating a new account under
				your name, a fake or borrowed name, or the name of any third
				party, even if you act on behalf of the third party.

			<p>
				21.5. In addition to terminating or suspending accounts, we
				reserve the right to take any appropriate legal action,
				including pursuing civil, criminal, or injunctive relief, as we

			</p>

			<h2>22. DISPUTE RESOLUTION</h2>

			<p>
				22.1. If you have any dispute or concern regarding the Services,
				you agree to first contact us at [your email address] and
				attempt to resolve the matter informally. Such informal
				negotiations shall last at least thirty (30) days from the date
				written notice is provided by one Party to the other.
			</p>

			<p>
				22.2. If the Parties are unable to resolve a Dispute through
				informal negotiations, the Dispute (except those expressly
				excluded below) will be finally and exclusively resolved by
				binding arbitration. YOU UNDERSTAND THAT WITHOUT THIS PROVISION,
				YOU WOULD HAVE THE RIGHT TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A JURY TRIAL.
			</p>

			<p>
				22.3. The arbitration shall be commenced and conducted under the
				Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration
				Association ("AAA") and, where appropriate, the AAA’s
				Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes ("AAA
				Consumer Rules"), available on the AAA website. Arbitration fees
				and arbitrator compensation shall be governed by the AAA
				Consumer Rules, and if such costs are deemed excessive, we will
				pay all arbitration fees and expenses.
			</p>

			<p>
				22.4. The arbitration may be conducted in person, through
				document submission, by phone, or online. The arbitrator will
				issue a written decision. The arbitrator must follow applicable
				law, and any award may be challenged if the arbitrator fails to
				do so. Except where otherwise required by applicable rules or
				law, the arbitration will take place in [Your City/State].
			</p>

			<p>
				22.5. If, for any reason, a Dispute proceeds in court rather
				than arbitration, the Dispute shall be brought exclusively in
				the state or federal courts located in [Your City/State], and
				the Parties consent to the jurisdiction of those courts. Both
				Parties waive defenses of lack of personal jurisdiction and
				forum non conveniens with respect to venue and jurisdiction.
			</p>

			<p>
				22.6. In no event shall any Dispute brought by either Party
				related to the Services be commenced more than one (1) year
				after the cause of action arose.
			</p>

			<p>
				22.7. The Parties agree that any arbitration shall be limited to
				the Dispute between the Parties individually. To the fullest
				extent permitted by law:
			</p>
			<ul class="ulLi">
				<li>
					(a) no arbitration shall be joined with any other
					proceeding;
				</li>
				<li>
					(b) there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be
					arbitrated on a class-action basis or to utilize class
					action procedures; and
				</li>
				<li>
					(c) there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be
					brought in a representative capacity on behalf of others.
				</li>
			</ul>

			<p>
				22.8. The following Disputes are not subject to the above
				provisions concerning informal negotiations or binding
				arbitration:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					(a) disputes seeking to enforce or protect intellectual
					property rights;
				</li>
				<li>
					(b) disputes related to allegations of theft, piracy,
					invasion of privacy, or unauthorized use; and
				</li>
				<li>(c) claims for injunctive relief.</li>
			</ul>
			<h2>23. GOVERNING LAW</h2>
			<p>
				23.1. These Terms and your use of the App and Services are
				governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the
				United States and, more specifically, the laws of the State of
				Kansas, applicable to agreements made and to be entirely
				performed within the State of Kansas, without regard to its
				conflict of law principles.
			</p>

			<h2>24. CALIFORNIA USERS AND RESIDENTS</h2>
			<p>
				24.1. If you are a California resident and a complaint regarding
				the App is not satisfactorily resolved, you may contact the
				Complaint Assistance Unit of the Division of Consumer Services
				of the California Department of Consumer Affairs.

			</p>

			<h2>25. MISCELLANEOUS</h2>
			<p>
				These Terms and any policies or operating rules posted by us on
				the Services or in respect to the Services constitute the entire
				agreement and understanding between you and Emdidi. Our failure
				to exercise or enforce any right or provision shall not operate
				as a waiver of that right or provision. These Terms operate to
				the fullest extent permissible by law, and we may assign any or
				all of our rights and obligations to others at any time.
			</p>
			<p>
				We are not responsible or liable for any loss, damage, delay, or
				failure to act caused by events beyond our reasonable control.
				If any provision or part of a provision of these Terms is
				determined to be unlawful, void, or unenforceable, that
				provision is deemed severable and does not affect the validity
				and enforceability of the remaining provisions.
			</p>
			<p>
				No partnership, joint venture, employment, or agency
				relationship is created between you and us as a result of these
				Terms or your use of the App. You agree that these Terms will
				not be construed against us as the drafter, and you waive any
				defenses based on the electronic form of these Terms or the lack
				of signatures by the parties.
			</p>
